**Gss Exploration - Sample web pages using GSS**

This small project contains some example of simple page layout using GSS. 

1) Six aligned squares. Vertically & Horizontally aligned in the page.

2) One page with two full screen sections. The first with a header and the second with a footer.
	- Note for this one: I have a problem doing the layout using VFL. Currently investigating why. I'll update
	the sample once I found. (to see the non-working version go to 'TwoSectionsHeaderFooterVFL.html').
